 Build Worlds in Minecraft with Python
=======================================

This documentation supports the `CoderDojo Twin Cities's`_ *Build
worlds in Minecraft with Python* code group. This group intends to
teach you how to use Python_, a general purpose programming language,
to mod the popular game called Minecraft_. It is targeted at students
aged 10 to 17 who have some programming experience in another
language. For example, in Scratch_.

Getting Help
============

Having trouble? Here are some pointers this might be useful:

* Take a look at the :doc:`FAQ <faq/index>`. We are loading this up
  with answers to common questions. Maybe the answer to your question
  is already here.

* Looking for specific information? You might find it in the
  :doc:`detailed table of contents <contents>`, or you might be able
  to use the :ref:`search` or :ref:`genindex` to help you locate it.

* Our :doc:`glossary <glossary>` might define a term that is new to
  you.

* If something is still unclear, we really would like to know. Please
  visit our `ticket tracker`_ to let us know about the problem. Use
  the :guilabel:`New Issue` button.

Other Setups
============

Here are some instructions for setting up software to support
different circumstances:

* **At Home, The Easy Way:** If you are interested in recreating the
  environment we use in the CoderDojo lab, but for a single user, on
  your own PC, you should consult our guide for :doc:`Vagrant
  <setup/vagrant>`.

* **At Home, The Hard Way:** If you are interested in installing all
  the software needed to run these examples directly on your PC
  (without using Vagrant to simplify the job), we currently have a
  guide that covers doing so on :doc:`Windows <setup/windows>`. Users
  of other platforms can consult this guide and try to adapt it for
  their circumstances. Ultimately, we intend to also provide guides
  for :doc:`Apple's OS X <setup/osx>` and :doc:`Ubuntu Linux
  <setup/ubuntu>`.

* **Running A Lab Server:** If you are responsible for running a lab
  server that hosts multiple student instances during a CoderDojo
  session, you should consult the :doc:`Lab Server
  <reference/lab-server>` guide.
