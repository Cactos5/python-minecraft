If you look through the documentation under the "In the Classroom"
heading on the link Matt provided, you will be familiar with the
basics of what we do to enable the students to work through the
exercises on Saturday. If you would like to work through the classroom
exercises on your own, I recommend the "At Home, The Easy Way" section
under Other Setups. I plan to push some minor updates to the
documentation still this evening or tomorrow morning, but it will
mostly be documentation improvements; the core tasks will remain the
same.

The code itself that makes up the exercises is available in our GitHub
repository: https://github.com/CoderDojoTC/python-minecraft. The code
is embedded in IPython Nodebook files (the *.IPYNB) in the
repository. You can use the online notebook viewer
(http://nbviewer.ipython.org) to turn these into easily readable
versions. Just paste the URL from the GitHub file into the box on the
NBViewer, and you will get a result like this:
