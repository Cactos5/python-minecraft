Lessons/Thoughts from 2015-01-24
================================

The WiFi setup on name-badges was much easier to manage than trying to
cross credentials off lists. It did take a little more coordination to
get WiFi set up on Dojo-provided PCs. We had to line up the badges on
the appropriate PCs, and then log them in.

We had a lot of students who came without a PC, or without a PC that
could run Minecraft (e.g., one student brought a Chromebook). This put
us behind the curve because several students didn't have a PC to work
from. We eventually settled on having them join another student with a
working PC, but it was suboptimal.

There are a variety of problems running Minecraft on the PCs:

* We had some student experience crashes upon trying to connect their
  PC to the server. They could join servers with 1.8, but on 1.7.10,
  they got a java OutOfBounds exception crash.
