What is a Mentor?
=================

Being a CoderDojo Mentor is like being a guide on an adventure. It
helps if you know where you're going, but more important is a sense of
curiousity and a willingness to work alongside the students as they
learn. We haven't had a chance yet to find write this guide about
being a mentor at the CoderDojo Twin Cities, but there are lots of
other resources available:

CoderDojo Twin Cities High-level Overview
=========================================

Events are usually held once or twice a month. Events are held on the
Saturdays on the University of Minnesota campus.

Students are in the classroom for about two hours, typically between
1:30pm and 3:30pm. Mentors are asked to arrive around 12:45pm to help
with setup, and to stay a bit after to help with cleanup.

Classroom setup includes:

#. Selecting the right number of tables for the expected number of
   students in each :term:`code group`. Each table in our usual
   classroom holds about nine students comfortably.

#. Retrieving the mentor and student name badges for the :term:`code
   group`, and stuffing them in the badge holders.

#. For students using classroom laptops, placing the laptops on the
   desks, connecting them to power supplies, logging them into the
   campus Wi-Fi, and preparing any needed software.

Students may either bring their own laptop, or use one of the
classroom laptops. Classroom laptops are all Apple Macs of varrying
vintages. Students arrive with a variety of different kinds of
computers. Most are running some version of Microsoft Windows.
