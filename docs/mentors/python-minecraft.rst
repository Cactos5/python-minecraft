 Being a Python Minecraft Mentor
=================================

The marketing material for the Python Minecraft code group describes
it as follows:

  Use Python, a general purpose programming language, to mod the
  popular Minecraft game.  Best for coders 10+ or younger with some
  experience in programming (like Scratch!)

It recommends that students be between the ages of 10 and 17, with
some experience in programming.

Mentors in this :term:`code group` ideally have some of the following
experience, though none of these are a hard requirement:

* Python programming.

* IPython usage.

* Minecraft usage.

* Teaching skills.
