 Being a Python Minecraft Mentor
=================================

The marketing material for the Python Minecraft code group describes it as follows:

  Use Python, a general purpose programming language, to mod the
  popular Minecraft game.  Best for coders 10+ or younger with some
  experience in programming (like Scratch!)

It recommends that students be between the ages of 10 and 17, with
some experience in programming.

Our Python Minecraft cirriculum is entirely contained in our `GitHub
repository`_. . The
code is embedded in IPython Nodebook files (the *.IPYNB) in the
repository. You can use the online notebook viewer
(http://nbviewer.ipython.org) to turn these into easily readable
versions. Just paste the URL from the GitHub file into the box on the
NBViewer, and you will get a result like this:
