   code group
      Code groups are topics in the Twin Cities' CoderDojo. When
      students sign up to addend, they indicate interest in three
      different code groups. They get assigned to a specific code
      group once the number of mentors is known. This usually happens
      a couple of days before the event.

   command line
      The command line is the place where you type commands and your
      computer executes them. On Windows, you need to launch the
      :command:`Command Prompt`. On Ubuntu Linux and on OS X, you can
      launch a program called :command:`Terminal`.

   lab instance
      In the hosted environment we use for the CoderDojo classes, each
      student has a private instance that contains a Minecraft server
      and world, an IPython notebook server, and copies of Python
      scripts with exercises and example programs.

   lab instance connection card
      A piece of paper that has the address of your private Minecraft
      server, the address of your private IPython notebook server, and
      the password needed to connect to it.
