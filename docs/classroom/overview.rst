===========================
 Overview of Today's Class
===========================

This section describes how we normally work in the CoderDojo classroom
and what to expect in today's session.


Organization and Introductions
==============================

We try to have around three students per mentor. After you first get
settled into your seat, take a few moments to get to know the mentors
and the other students sitting near you. Here are some example
questions to break the ice:

* What's your name?

* What grade are you in? Or for mentors, what year were you last in
  school?

* Have you attended (or mentored) this class before?

* What kind of experience do you have with programming?

* Why did you come to this class today? What are you hoping to do or
  learn?

Be sure to talk to the people around you. You may have something to
teach them, and they may know something you want to learn. This isn't
a library, so you won't get into trouble for talking. Making friends,
sharing stories, and working together are all OK.


Learning Objectives
===================

Here are some of the things you will learn while participating in
today's class:

* How to read, write, and run code in IPython

* Basic Python syntax

* How to change the Minecraft world using Python

* How to have the Minecraft world trigger activity in Python

* Anything else you want! Be sure to talk to a mentor if there is
  something specific you are looking to learn.


Order of Events
===============

Here's how things typically happen in the CoderDojo classroom:

#. Get connected. This means getting your PC onto the Wi-Fi network,
   and then getting connected to your :term:`lab instance`.

#. Work through each exercise. We have several exercises, each
   designed to teach you different things about the IPython notebook
   environment, Python programming, and interacting with Minecraft
   through Python code. The exercises are numbered, and it's a good
   idea to tackle them in order.

#. Look at the other examples. See if you can understand what they do,
   and think about how you might want to change them. Then give it a
   try!


Ground Rules
============

In CoderDojo, **the one rule is "be cool".** Putting this into
practice in the classroom, you can be cool by:

* **Helping each other.** Check with other students before asking a
  mentor for help. "Ask three, then me," is a good rule of thumb.

* **Learning Python.** Today's focus is on programming, not the game
  of Minecraft. Remember, this is a CoderDojo, not a LAN party!


Now that you know how this class works, it's time to learn how to get
started with the :doc:`first steps for setup <setup>`.
