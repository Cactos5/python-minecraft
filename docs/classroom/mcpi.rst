 Controlling Minecraft from Python
===================================

Coordinate System
=================

Most coordinates are in the form of a three integer vector (x,y,z)
which address a specific tile in the game world. (0,0,0) is the spawn
point sea level. (X,Z) is the ground plane, and Y is towards the
sky. In other words, X is left and right, Z is forward and backward,
and Y is up and down.

Minecraft Programming Reference
===============================

These are just a few highlights. A more detailed reference can be
found in the `full API reference`_.

.. _full API reference: http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/p/minecraft-api-reference.html


World
-----

.. py:function:: world.getBlock(x, y, z)

   Look up the type of block at the specified coordinates.

.. py:function:: world.setBlock(x, y, z, block_type)

   Set the block at the specified coordinates to the type block_type.

.. py:function:: world.setBlocks(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, block_type)

   Create a set of blocks starting at one coordinate point extending
   to another point with blocks of the type block_type. This can be
   used to make cubes or rectangles.

.. py:function:: world.getHeight(x, z)

   Look up the height (y coordinate) of the tallest brick at the
   specified x and y coordinates.

.. py:function:: world.postToChat("Message")

   Send a message over chat.


Player
------

.. py:function:: player.getPos()

   Look up the coordinates that the player is currently positioned at.

.. py:function:: player.setPos(x,y,z)

   Set the playerâ€™s position to the specified coordinates.


Blocks
------

As is the case in most things related to programming, the
:file:`mcpi/block.py` `source code file`_ is the ultimate authority
for which blocks are available for your use. The table below lists
those constants and includes a few notes about some of the blocks.

The underlying engine actually provides all of `these block types`_.
If you see one is missing from the MCPI ``block`` module, you are free
to edit :file:`mcpi/block.py` to add more blocks using the decimal
value listed and following the pattern you find in the existing code.
