 Other Scripts to Explore
==========================

In addition to the prepared IPython exercises, your IPython instance
has access to plenty of other IPython examples. The examples should be
visible in your IPython notebook session, under the folder named
:file:`examples`. If you cannot see the :file:`examples` folder in
IPython, click on the icon of the house to navigate to the top level
folder.

Here are some that might be fun to play with:

sphere.py
   This script creates spherical objects in your Minecraft world.

sphere_hollow.py
   This script shows you how to make spheres hollow: fill them with
   air. This technique comes in handy in other places, too.

sleepyoz_analogclock.py
   This script is awfully complex, but it draws and animates an analog
   clock in your Minecraft world. Really cool.

.. todo:: Test and summarize more of the classic scripts.
