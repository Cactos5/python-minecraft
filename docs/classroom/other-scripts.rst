 Other Scripts to Explore
==========================

In addition to the prepared IPython exercises, your IPython instance
has access to plenty of other Python scripts. They don't show up in
your view by default, but you saw how to list them and load them in
*Exercise 2: Getting Started with IPython*. Here are some that might
be fun to play with:

sphere.py
   This script creates spherical objects in your Minecraft world.

sphere_hollow.py
   This script shows you how to make spheres hollow: fill them with
   air. This technique comes in handy in other places, too.

sleepyoz_analogclock.py
   This script is awfully complex, but it draws and animates an analog
   clock in your Minecraft world. Really cool.

.. todo:: Test and summarize more of the classic scripts.

You can also look through the scripts in the online python-minecraft_
repository.
