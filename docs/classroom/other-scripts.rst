 Other Scripts to Explore
==========================

In addition to the prepared IPython exercises, your IPython instance
has access to plenty of other IPython examples. The examples should be
visible in your IPython notebook session, under the folder named
:file:`examples`. If you cannot see the :file:`examples` folder in
IPython, click on the icon of the house to navigate to the top level
folder.

Here are some that might be fun to play with:

Simple Sripts
=============

These scripts are pretty simple, and good places for beginners to
start:

-----

This simple script creates a block that flips between different
block types, making it seem to blink.


Moderate Sripts
===============

These scripts are a step more complex. Move on to these when you are
ready for a challenge.

----------------

This script makes a "snake" of TNT through your world.


sphere
------

This script creates spherical objects in your Minecraft world.


sphere_hollow
-------------

This script shows you how to make spheres hollow: fill them with
air. This technique comes in handy in other places, too.


Advanced Sripts

These scripts are really complex. If you can figure these out, you are
ready to make your own Mods.


sleepyoz_analogclock
--------------------

This script draws and animates an analog clock in your Minecraft
world. Really cool.
