 First Steps for Setup
=======================

To participate in today's classroom activities, you need a few things:

#. Get a PC. If you brought your own, you're set. Plug it in and get
   comfortable. If not, look for an unoccupied classroom PC at one of
   the Python-Minecraft tables. If none are available, talk to a
   mentor.

#. Next, talk to mentor to get your :term:`lab instance connection
   card`. This card has the unique details you need to connect to the
   instance. We will need your Mojang account name (the player name,
   inside Minecraft) so we can set up your instance and give your
   player permission to connect to it. If you don't have a Mojang
   account, we have several available for use in the classroom.

#. Make sure your PC is connected to Wi-Fi. If you are using a
   classroom PC, this may have already been set up. This is covered in
   more detail in the :doc:`Wi-Fi instructions <wifi>`.

#. Connect to your IPython Notebook and Minecraft worlds. If you are
   using a classroom PC, this may have already been set up. This is
   covered in more detail in the :doc:`lab instance setup instructions
   <lab-instance>`.

#. Test the connection between Python and Minecraft. Even if you are
   using a classroom PC, it is good to test out the connection
   yourself. Instructions are :doc:`here <test>`.

Now that you have a high-level understanding, make sure you have
:doc:`Wi-Fi setup <wifi>`.
