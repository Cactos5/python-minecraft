==================
 Connect to Wi-Fi
==================

The official documentation for connecting to the UMN campus Wi-Fi is
available in the `WiFi Setup Guides`_. You should look at the section
for your specific operating system under the heading *UoM Secure*.

.. _WiFi Setup Guides: http://it.umn.edu/wifi-setup-guides

That said, you might be able to muddle through setting up a connection
using only the key bits of information below:

* Connect to the ``UofM Secure`` SSID.

* Choose ``WPA2-Enterprise`` security.

* Choose ``AES`` encryption.

* If you're only visiting the campus for a short time to participate
  in a CoderDojo event, it is probably unnecessary to configure the
  *Protected EAP* properties or to mess around with any advanced
  settings like 802.1X or its certificates. Skipping those steps means
  you can't be positive that your PC is talking to the
  University-provided Wi-Fi infrastructure, but the risk is pretty
  low.

  .. warning:: However, if you live, study, or work on campus, take
               the extra time to go through all the setup steps in the
               official documentation so you stay secure.


Once Wi-Fi is working and you are able to visit websites (try the
`CoderDojo site`_), move on to :doc:`connecting to your lab instance
<lab-instance>`.
